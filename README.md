# Symptoms Checker Program

This program allows users to input their symptoms and checks for potential diagnoses such as Atherosclerosis, Colon, or Ulcus based on the selected symptoms.

## Symptoms List

The program provides a list of symptoms to choose from. Each symptom is assigned a number:

1. Blood pressure
2. Angina pectoris
3. Nausea
4. Diarrhea and dyssynergic defaecation
5. Drinking alcohol
6. Obesity
7. Hereditary factor for atherosclerosis

10. Lower abdominal pain
11. Severe vomiting
12. Abdominal distention

Users can enter the number corresponding to each symptom they are experiencing, one at a time. The program validates the input and keeps track of the selected symptoms.

The program then checks the symptoms against predefined conditions to determine the diagnosis. If a match is found, it provides recommendations and instructions for the specific diagnosis.
